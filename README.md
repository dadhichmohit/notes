# TG's Notes
A Git repository is where the CS algorithms and programming notes should reside and this repo hosts mine!
(As of 2015,) I am implementing the algorithms I am learning/revising or practising in my master's course.
In addition, I have included few scripts and snippets useful for few day to day tasks. Some of the algorithms
require datasets to test, so the data are either pushed in or have scripts to download. 

## How its organized :
Look around, make sense of directory and file names!
